# Stock analysis app

## Description
This project is a basic stock app. Page 1 - stock analysis - can input a stock ticker and track its performance overtime. Page 2 - custom portfolio vs S&P 500 - create a custom portfolio and track its performance against the S&P 500.
This app is somewhat rushed as it was made to display my Rshiny skills.

## Future plans
Create checks for each input box/ error catch messages
Make plots interactive using ggplotly
